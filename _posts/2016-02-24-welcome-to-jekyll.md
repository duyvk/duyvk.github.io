You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$.

Now a inline math with special character: $|\psi\rangle$, $x'$, $x^\*$.

Test a display math:
$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
\begin{equation}
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
\end{equation}
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
$$
  \begin{align}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
  \end{align}
$$
Is it O.K.?

Test a display math with equation number:
\begin{align}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
\end{align}
Is it O.K.?

And test a display math without equaltion number:
\begin{align\*}
    |\psi_1\rangle &= a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle \\\\
    |\psi_2\rangle &= c|0\rangle + d|1\rangle
\end{align\*}
Is it O.K.?
